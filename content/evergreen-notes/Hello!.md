I'm Prabha, a data scientist by trade. You've stumbled into the extension of my brain. 

Lately I've been trying to understand AI tools and how they feature in my work as a data scientist in healthcare. This is an attempt to capture what I am [[currently thinking about]]. Feel free to pick a link and follow along. 
I'm trying to use this as a playground to run experiments, discuss my thoughts and learn together! 

Shoot me an [email](sahitiprabha@gmail.com) to let me know what you think about some of the things I've been doing here!
